## Installation

### DEB (Debian/Ubuntu/Pop!_OS)
Download the latest `.deb` from Releases.
```bash
sudo apt install ./wlaunch.deb
systemctl --user enable --now wlaunch-daemon  # Enable clipboard history
```

### RPM (Fedora/RedHat)
Download the latest `.rpm` from Releases.
```bash
sudo rpm -i wlaunch.rpm
systemctl --user enable --now wlaunch-daemon
```

### Manual
1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kpanuragh/wlaunch.git
    cd wlaunch
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install PyQt6 pyxdg
    ```
3.  Run:

## Usage

### Keybindings (i3)
Add this to your `~/.config/i3/config`:
```i3
bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id wlaunch
```

### Clipboard Daemon
To ensure your clipboard history is tracked even when the launcher is closed, ensure the background service is running:
```bash
wlaunch-daemon &
```
(The package installs a systemd user service for this automatically).

## Configuration
*   **Styles:** Edit `/usr/share/wlaunch/styles.qss` (or local `styles.qss`) to customize the look.
*   **Scripts:** Put executable files in `~/.config/wlaunch/scripts/`.
